# Python package for ONNX Runtime generate() API

Run generative AI models with ONNX Runtime.

This library provides the generative AI loop for ONNX models, including pre and post processing, inference with ONNX Runtime, logits processing, search and sampling, and KV cache management.

Users can call a high level generate() method, or run each iteration of the model in a loop.
